## Feint Dice

### What is it?

Built with v0
Vite Typescript
ThreeJS

### Why?

To understand the bounds of v0.

### Game design

5v5 dice. The top die represents the
activation order for your dice. Highest value
dice are activated first and this target changes
as the game progresses.

Colliding with other dice you do not control will destroy
them both. Move a die into the opposing flag station to win.
